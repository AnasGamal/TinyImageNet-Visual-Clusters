# Image Recognition on Tiny-ImageNet with CLIP
# Using the CLIP model and t-SNE for visualization

This code generates a visualization of the images in a subset of the Tiny-ImageNet dataset, using the CLIP model and t-SNE. The visualization shows each image labeled with its predicted class.

The code uses the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to group similar images together. The color of each cluster is determined by the average color of the images in that cluster.

The code uses the following libraries:

* datasets (for loading and manipulating the Tiny-ImageNet dataset)
* transformers (for loading the CLIP model)
* PIL (for image manipulation)
* numpy and scikit-learn (for data manipulation and clustering)
* matplotlib (for visualization)

The code has been tested on Python 3.12.1

## Usage

To run the code, simply execute `python imgrec.py`. The visualization will be saved to a file called `tsne_visualization_high_res.png`.

## Visualization Example

The following is an example visualization generated by the code:
